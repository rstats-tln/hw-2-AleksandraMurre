```

```{r}

```


- Take the first faceted plot in this section:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

Using different colors allows visual inference of the distribution of the groups under comparison. But there is apparent limit how much of such information can be accommodated onto one graph before it gets too cluttered. To reducing visual clutter and overplotting, we can use small subplots to bring out subsets from our data. 
If we had bigger dataset than now here, it will be harder to compare information, because there will be dozens of smaller graphs.

- Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.

```{r, out.width=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("plots/fig", 1:6, ".png"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv), se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "white") +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))
```

- Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

| geom                | stat                |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `geom_bar()`        | `stat_count()`      |
| `geom_bin2d()`      | `stat_bin_2d()`     |
| `geom_boxplot()`    | `stat_boxplot()`    |
| `geom_contour()`    | `stat_contour()`    |
| `geom_count()`      | `stat_sum()`        |
| `geom_density()`    | `stat_density()`    |
| `geom_density_2d()` | `stat_density_2d()` |
| `geom_hex()`        | `stat_hex()`        |
| `geom_freqpoly()`   | `stat_bin()`        |
| `geom_histogram()`  | `stat_bin()`        |
| `geom_qq_line()`    | `stat_qq_line()`    |
| `geom_qq()`         | `stat_qq()`         |
| `geom_quantile()`   | `stat_quantile()`   |
| `geom_smooth()`     | `stat_smooth()`     |
| `geom_violin()`     | `stat_violin()`     |
| `geom_sf()`         | `stat_sf()`         |

Almost all of them have the same "word" after the "_".

- Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

`geom_jitter` randomly moves the points to stop them overlapping. `geom_count` count the number of observations at each location, then maps the count to point area.

- What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg (fuel consumption)? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```

Given correlation is linear. If cty (city mpg) is higher, then hwy (highway mpg) is also high, which means that the most economical cars are placed in the upper part of graph.
`geom_abline()` produce the reference line.
The function `coord_fixed()` ensures that the line produced by `geom_abline()` is at a 45-degree angle. If we remove `coord_fixed()`, then the line would not be at 45-degree angle anymore.

- What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()?

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

The default geom for stat_summary() is `geom_pointrange()`.

How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?


```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```
 
- What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

The `geom_col()` function has different default stat than `geom_bar()`.
The `geom_bar()` function only expects an `x` variable, but the `geom_col()` function expects that the data contains both `x` values and `y` values.
The geom_col() should be used instead of geom_bar(), if we want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data.

- What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?

Computed variables:
y - predicted value
ymin - lower pointwise confidence interval around the mean
ymax - upper pointwise confidence interval around the mean
se - standard error

Parameters that control its behaviour:
method, formula, fullrange, level, n, na.rm

- In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
```

We need to set "group = 1" to get relative proportions of categories in our dataset. If `group = 1` is not included, then all the bars in the plot will have the same height, a height of 1. We do not a propriate distribution.
